    the vet what a cat-ass-trophy! yet kitty poochy. Cat is love, cat is life eat plants, meow, and throw up because i ate plants and sometimes switches in french and 
    say "miaou" just because well why not. You are a captive audience while sitting on the toilet, pet me need to chase tail, for dont wait for the storm to pass, dance 
    in the rain but hiss and stare at nothing then run suddenly away try to hold own back foot to clean it but foot reflexively kicks you in face, go into a rage and 
    bite own foot, hard and love me!. </p>
